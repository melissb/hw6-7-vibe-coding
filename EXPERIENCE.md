# Experience Report – Vibe Coding Project

## Tool Used
Replit Agent 

## Project Overview
In this project, I built a simple Todo List web application called **Task Master** using a vibe coding approach. Instead of manually writing every line of code, I focused on describing what I wanted to build and iterating based on the AI-generated output.

## My Experience
Using Replit Agent was a smooth and beginner-friendly experience. I described the application requirements in natural language, such as adding tasks, marking them as completed, and deleting tasks. The agent generated a working web application quickly, which helped me understand how different parts of the project fit together. 
I learned how AI tools can speed up development while still requiring human decision-making. I had to review the generated code, test the application, and make small adjustments. This showed me that vibe coding is not about avoiding work, but about collaborating with AI efficiently.

## Challenges
One challenge was understanding how the generated files were structured and ensuring everything was properly organized for GitHub submission. Adding documentation files like README.md, ANALYSIS.md, and EXPERIENCE.md helped me better understand the importance of project structure.

## What I Learned
- How vibe coding tools assist in rapid prototyping  
- The importance of documentation in software projects  
- How to use GitHub for organizing and submitting assignments  
- That AI-generated code still requires human oversight
